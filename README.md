# clicky-game


A memory game built to practice my React.js skills!

Click on an image of a collection of characters from a galaxy far far away!

Score points by clicking on a new character, React's stateful components will record each character clicked and shuffle them around on each click.

Your score increases each time a new character is clicked and saves your high score

this data is not persistent and any refreshing of the browser will result in a loss of scores
